# Concept Design from Assignment 2

### ðŸ§© 1. UserAuth

Purpose:
Authenticate users so that only verified members can place orders.

Principle:
If a user registers with a username and password, then logs in using the same credentials, they are authenticated as that user.

State:

```
a set of Users with
  a username String
  a password String
```

Actions:

register(username, password)

login(username, password)

logout(user)

### ðŸ§© 2. Membership \[User]

Purpose:
Track user membership status and privileges.

Principle:
If a user signs up for membership, they gain access to member-only actions (like ordering).

State:

```
a set of Users with
  a joinDate Date
  a semester String // F25, S25
  a price Number
  an active Boolean
```

Actions:

createMembership(user)

toggleActive(user, active)

### ðŸ§© 3. Menu \[Option]

Purpose:
Define the items available to order at the cafÃ©.

Principle:
If an admin adds an item to the menu, it becomes visible to members when ordering.

State:

```
a set of Items with
  a name String
  a description String
  a set of Options
  a available Boolean
```

Actions:

addItem(name, description, option, available)

removeItem(item)

toggleAvailability(item, available)

### ðŸ§© 4. Order \[User, Item]

Purpose:
Let members place and view orders.

Principle:
If a member selects menu items and places an order, the system records it and marks it as completed once prepared.

State:

```
a set of Orders with
  a user User
  a items set of Item
  a status String  // "pending", "ready", "completed"
  a createdAt Date
```

Actions:

createOrder(user, items)

updateStatus(order, status)

cancelOrder(order)

Sync Example:

sync AllowOrder
when Request.createOrder(user, items)
where in Membership: active(user) is true
then Order.createOrder(user, items)

### ðŸ§© 5. CustomerFeedback \[User, Order]

Purpose:
Let members provide feedback after an order is completed.

Principle:
After completing an order, a member can rate or comment on it for quality tracking.

State:

```
a set of Feedback with
  a user User
  an order Order
  a comment String
  a createdAt Date
  a public Boolean
```

Actions:

submitFeedback(user, order, rating, comment)

\_getFeedbackByOrder(order)

Sync Example:

sync FeedbackEligibility
when Order.updateStatus(order, "completed")
where in Membership: active(user(order)) is true
then allow CustomerFeedback.submitFeedback(user(order), order)

### ðŸ§© 6. UserProfile \[User]

Purpose:
Store and update each userâ€™s public info separate from authentication.

Principle:
If a user edits their profile, their display name and preferences update across the app.

State:

```
a set of Users with
  a name String
  a favoriteDrink String
  a bio String
  a classYear Number
  a major String
  a type String // customer, barista
  a score Number
```

Actions:

updateProfile(user, displayName, favoriteDrink, bio)

\_getProfile(user)

### ðŸ§© 7. Option

Purpose:
\[Todo]

Principle:
\[Todo]

State:

```
a set of Option with
  a key String
  a set of values String
```

Actions:

addOption(name, description, option, available)

removeItem(item)

toggleAvailability(item, available)
